### assignment4
#### This project has two parts:
1. calculate BSM call price with given sigma 
2. calibration the implied volatility with given call price
#### the structure of code is as following:
1. calculate the call price with given sigma(0.3) by BSM
2. calculate the implied volatility with given call price(9.23)
#### for detailed code and description, please refer to https://github.com/wallace2213/MA6628-assignment4/blob/master/BSM%20call%20calculation%20and%20calibration%20volatility.py
#### result and output
#### the BSM call price with 30% volatility=19.77 which is much larger than the market call price 9.23
#### the implied volatility with given market call price= 11.8%
